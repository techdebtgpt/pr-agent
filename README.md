# PR Agent

An AI-powered GitHub Action that automatically analyzes pull requests using Claude AI and provides intelligent code review insights, risk assessments, and complexity ratings.

## Overview

PR Agent analyzes your pull requests and provides:
- **Summary**: Clear description of what the change does and its purpose
- **Potential Risks**: Identification of possible bugs, edge cases, or issues
- **Complexity Rating**: A 1-5 scale rating of the PR's complexity
- **Actionable Insights**: Specific recommendations for reviewers

## Prerequisites

Before setting up PR Agent in your project, you'll need:

1. **Anthropic API Key**: Sign up at [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/) to get your API key
2. **GitHub Repository**: With permissions to add workflows and secrets

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Add PR Agent to Your Repository

You have two options:

#### Option A: Use as a GitHub Action from marketplace (recommended)

1. Create a workflow file in your repository:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .github/workflows
   ```

2. Create `.github/workflows/pr-agent.yml`:
   ```yaml
   name: PR Analyzer
   on:
     pull_request:
       types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]
   
   permissions:
     pull-requests: write
     issues: write
     contents: read
   
   jobs:
     analyze:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v4
   
         - name: Run PR Analyzer
           uses: techdebtgpt/pr-agent@v1.0.1
           with:
             config-path: .pr-analyzer.yml
           env:
             ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
             GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

   ```

#### Option B: Clone and customize locally

1. Clone this repository into your project:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/pr-agent.git .github/pr-agent
   ```

2. Create `.github/workflows/pr-agent.yml` as shown above, adjusting the path accordingly.

### Step 2: Configure Secrets

Add your Anthropic API key to your repository secrets:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Navigate to **Settings** â†’ **Secrets and variables** â†’ **Actions**
3. Click **New repository secret**
4. Name: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
5. Value: Your Anthropic API key
6. Click **Add secret**

> **Note**: `GITHUB_TOKEN` is automatically provided by GitHub Actions, no manual setup required.

## Usage

### Automatic Analysis

Once set up, PR Agent automatically runs on:
- New pull requests (`opened`)
- Updates to existing pull requests (`synchronize`)
- Reopened pull requests (`reopened`)

### What Happens

1. **PR Opened/Updated**: When a PR is created or updated, the workflow triggers
2. **Fetch Changes**: The action retrieves all file changes (diffs) from the PR
3. **AI Analysis**: Sends the diff to Claude AI for analysis
4. **Post Comment**: Posts a comprehensive analysis comment on the PR

### Example Output

When PR Agent analyzes your pull request, it posts a comment like:

```markdown
## ðŸ¤– AI Analysis

### Summary
This PR refactors the authentication middleware to use JWT tokens instead of session-based auth. It introduces a new TokenService class and updates all route handlers to use the new authentication method.

### Potential Risks
- The migration from session to JWT may break existing authenticated users
- No token expiration handling is implemented in the TokenService
- Error handling in the authenticate middleware could expose sensitive information

### Complexity: 4/5
This is a significant architectural change affecting multiple parts of the application. Careful testing of all authenticated endpoints is recommended.

### Recommendations
- Add integration tests for the new authentication flow
- Implement token refresh mechanism
- Review error messages to ensure no sensitive data leaks
```

## Development Setup

If you want to contribute or modify PR Agent:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/pr-agent.git
cd pr-agent
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Build the Project

```bash
npm run build:action
```
Creates the `dist/` directory that is neccessary for the build to run

### 4. Test Locally

To test the action locally, you can:

1. Set environment variables:
   ```bash
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key"
   ```

2. Create a test PR in a repository you own
3. Run the action (requires GitHub Actions context)

## Project Structure

```
pr-agent/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ action.ts      # Main GitHub Action entry point
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ analyzer.ts    # Claude AI integration
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ types.ts       # TypeScript type definitions
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.ts       # Additional exports
â”œâ”€â”€ dist/              # Compiled JavaScript (generated)
â”œâ”€â”€ action.yml         # GitHub Action configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ .pr-analyzer.yml   # PR Analyzer file configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json       # Node.js dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ tsconfig.json      # TypeScript configuration
â””â”€â”€ README.md          # This file
```

## How It Works

1. **Trigger**: GitHub Action triggers on PR events
2. **Fetch Diffs**: Uses GitHub API to retrieve all changed files and their diffs
3. **Prepare Prompt**: Constructs a detailed prompt with the PR title and diffs
4. **AI Analysis**: Sends to Claude 3.5 Sonnet for analysis
5. **Parse Response**: Extracts structured insights from Claude's response
6. **Post Comment**: Creates a formatted comment on the PR using GitHub API

## Troubleshooting

### Action Not Running

- Verify workflow file is in `.github/workflows/` directory
- Check workflow triggers match PR events
- Ensure repository permissions allow Actions to run

### No Comments Posted

- Verify `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` secret is set correctly
- Check workflow permissions include `pull-requests: write`
- Review Action logs for error messages

### Analysis Failed

- Check if your Anthropic API key is valid and has available credits
- Verify the API key has not expired
- Review Action logs for detailed error messages

### Large PRs

- For very large PRs, the diff might exceed token limits
- Consider breaking large PRs into smaller, focused changes
- Future versions will include diff size limits and chunking
