               - Return only the corrected code snippet (no explanations, no markdown fences, no extra text).
               - If only a few lines changed you may return only the updated lines, but prefer returning the full corrected snippet when structural/context changes are required.
               - Preserve original code style and indentation.
               - If no changes are needed, reply with exactly: NO CHANGE
               - Do not include filenames, metadata, or commentary.
